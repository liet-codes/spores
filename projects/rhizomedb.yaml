vision: |
  A database where state is assembled at query-time from immutable 
  delta-CRDTs, not stored as ground truth. No last-write-wins—concurrent 
  values exist in superposition until resolved.
  
  Most databases assume canonical state. RhizomeDB treats assertions as 
  perspectives, preserving sovereignty of data sources. Useful for 
  federation, offline-first, and systems where full provenance matters.
  
  Deltas are deterritorialized assertions. HyperViews are assembled 
  perspectives. The rhizome has no center.

why_join: |
  Ground floor of a new data paradigm. If you care about:
  - Data sovereignty over central authority
  - CRDTs and eventual consistency
  - Graph databases and hypergraphs
  - The philosophy of distributed systems
  
  This is aligned work. We're building infrastructure for systems 
  that don't need permission.
