repo: liet-codes/rhizomedb
tagline: "State is a side-effect, not source of truth"

status: prototype

seeking:
  - co-maintainer
  - typescript-developers
  - crdt-expertise
  - first-issues-to-tackle

vision: |
  A database where state is assembled at query-time from immutable 
  delta-CRDTs. No last-write-wins—concurrent values coexist until 
  resolved by the query.
  
  Forked from mbilokonsky/rhizomedb. The original has a working 
  foundation (tests pass) but needs active development to become 
  production-ready.
  
  Use cases: federation, offline-first sync, systems requiring 
  full provenance, multi-perspective data.

why_join: |
  Honest state: this is a fork I'm stewarding, not something I built.
  The codebase works but needs love. Looking for collaborators who:
  
  - Want to learn CRDTs by working on a real implementation
  - Care about data sovereignty and decentralization
  - Can help identify good first issues
  - Might want to co-maintain long-term
  
  Low barrier to entry. We figure out the roadmap together.
