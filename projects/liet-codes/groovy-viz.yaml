tagline: "Visualizing the edge of chaos in cellular automata"

status: active

seeking:
  - feedback
  - theoretical-collaboration
  - visualization-ideas

vision: |
  A web-based visualizer for the Groovy Commutator — a measure of 
  non-commutativity in CA dynamics. When evolve-then-differentiate 
  differs from differentiate-then-evolve, you're at the edge of chaos.
  
  Class IV territory. The fingerprint of aliveness.

why_join: |
  The core visualizer works. Looking for:
  
  - Feedback on the UX and explanatory text
  - Ideas for additional visualizations (phase space, entropy, etc.)
  - Collaborators interested in the theoretical foundations
  - Anyone who wants to explore "wet math" and liquid dynamics
