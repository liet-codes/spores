vision: |
  Interactive visualizer for 1D cellular automata that computes the 
  "groovy commutator"—a measure of non-commutativity between evolution 
  and differentiation operators.
  
  When G(S) ≠ 0 with structure, you're at the edge of chaos. Class IV 
  territory. This is "Secret Math"—the fingerprint of aliveness in 
  rule-based systems.
  
  The tool helps identify where order-of-operations creates interesting 
  dynamics vs. where it doesn't matter.

  If you're interested in:
  - Cellular automata and emergence
  - Edge of chaos / Class IV dynamics
  - Mathematical visualization
  - The philosophy of computation
  
  This is a small, focused project with clear scope. Good for 
  a first contribution or ongoing collaboration.
